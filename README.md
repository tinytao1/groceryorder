# Produce Order Helper - Training Project

This app is meant to translate the letters and checkmarks of a grocery order into a list of produce names and quantities.

This is my third coding project.  
Here, for the first time, I have utilized a loop, and a corresponding array - FUN times!  
I've gotten much more comfortable accessing, reading/writing, input elements.  
A big challenge for me in this project was writing the conditional statements to give the checkbox rows their autofilling behaviors, which have several aspects: a sort of "forward", "backward", "neutral", and "clear/uncheck" action.  

Now that the webpage is working, when I look back on the build process I can see lots of room for improvement.  
Repeating code: The code is repeating all over the place.  
Global variables: Globals are undesirable. I had no idea about this when I started the project, and the code is stuffed to breaking with them.  
Objects: I've got none. And I've never used one. But I'm ready to implement them, and I expect they will greatly reduce the footprint (repetition) of the code.
